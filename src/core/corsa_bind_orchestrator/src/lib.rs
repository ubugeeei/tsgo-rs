//! Orchestration layers for coordinating one or more `tsgo` workers.
//!
//! The orchestration crates are where `corsa-bind` can outperform naive CLI usage:
//! by prewarming workers, reusing snapshots, memoizing results, and replicating
//! editor state, higher-level workflows avoid paying full initialization cost
//! for every query.
//!
//! # Entry Points
//!
//! - [`ApiOrchestrator`] manages a local pool of API workers plus caches.
//! - distributed replication is available only with the
//!   `experimental-distributed` cargo feature.
//! - `DistributedApiOrchestrator` mirrors that state through an in-process
//!   Raft implementation for multi-node experiments and tests.
