//! Shared primitives used across the `corsa` workspace.
//!
//! This crate intentionally stays small and foundational. It contains the
//! common error type, process lifecycle helpers, and a few performance-oriented
//! collection/string aliases used throughout the higher-level crates.
//!
//! Most applications will consume this crate indirectly via `corsa_client`
//! or the top-level `corsa` facade, but it is also useful on its own when
//! embedding `tsgo` process management in another integration.
