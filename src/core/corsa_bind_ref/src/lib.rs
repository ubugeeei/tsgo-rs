//! Managed-reference utilities for the pinned `typescript-go` checkout.
//!
//! The workspace keeps an upstream `typescript-go` checkout under
//! `origin/typescript-go` and treats it as a reproducible input for regression
//! tests, benchmarks, and CI. This crate owns the lockfile format and the logic
//! that verifies the checkout really matches that pin.
//!
//! Typical consumers use [`TsgoRefManager`] to:
//!
//! - inspect the current managed checkout
//! - fail fast when the checkout drifts
//! - synchronize the checkout back to the pinned commit
//! - refresh the lockfile from the current checkout intentionally
